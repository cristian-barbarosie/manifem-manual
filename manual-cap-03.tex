\chapter{~~Frontal mesh generation; knitting}\label{\numb section 3}
          %-------------------------------------%

Section \ref{\numb section 2} shows how to build meshes by joining together several regular meshes
(triangles or quadrangles), like patches.
The present section explains how to build a mesh by gradually adding cells, on by one.
We call this approach ``frontal mesh generation'' because we gradually propagate a front of segments.
In some cases, the process starts with a given interface and adds triangles, one by one,
moving and deforming the interface, until it shrinks and disappears.
In other cases (like in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2},
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4}, \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6},
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 7}) we begin with nothing at all;
{\maniFEM} finds a starting point by itself.

Frontal mesh generation works with segment cells (for one-dimensional meshes) and
triangular cells (for two-dimensional meshes).
Meshing of three-dimensional domains will be implemented in the future and will use tetrahedral
cells.

Frontal mesh generation follows the shape of the current working manifold (the most recently
declared {\small\tt\verm{Manifold}} object) by {\small\tt project}ing each newly constructed vertex
on that manifold.
Recall that in this manual we use the term ``manifold'' to mean a manifold without boundary.

\section{~~Filling a disk}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 1}
          %--------------%

Paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 9} shows how to build a mesh over a disk,
but the quality of the mesh is quite poor.
This is so because the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor with
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::quadrangle} treats the disk as a (much) deformed rectangle.

We can ask {\maniFEM} to mesh the disk, starting from its boundary (a circle)
and adding triangles, one by one, until the disk is completely covered :

\end{Verbatim}

We provide the desired length of the segments of the future mesh as an argument to the
constructor.
Of course the length of the segments inside the mesh will vary slightly.
We must take care to give as boundary a curve with segments of length approximatively equal
to the desired length (paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 16} discusses
this requirement).

Paragraph \ref{\numb section 11.\numb parag 2} explains the coloring conventions observed
in this manual for {\tt C++} code.
Paragraph \ref{\numb section 11.\numb parag 3} gives details about {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}}s.

\section{~~Meshing a circle}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2}
          %----------------%

Instead of building the circle by joining four (curved) segments, we can mesh directly
the circle manifold, then mesh the disk :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,frame=single,
   label=parag-\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2}.cpp,rulecolor=\color{moldura},
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                                            ]
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{RR2} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Euclid, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_dim, \laranja{2} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{xy} = RR2 .build_coordinate_system ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Lagrange, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_degree, \laranja{1} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{x} = xy [\laranja{0}], \azul{y} = xy [\laranja{1}];
   
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{circle_manif} = RR2 .implicit ( x*x + y*y == \laranja{1.} );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal,
                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::entire_manifold, circle_manif, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.2} );
   \cinza{// we can omit the manifold; maniFEM will take the current working manifold :}
   \cinza{// Mesh circle ( tag::frontal, tag::desired_length, 0.2 );}
   
   RR2 .set_as_working_manifold();
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{disk} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::boundary, circle, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.2} );
   disk .draw_ps (\verde{"disk.eps"});
\end{Verbatim}

The code above is quite comfortable for the user; he or she only needs to define
the manifold(s) to be meshed and provide the desired (average) length of segments
in the future mesh.
However, this comfort comes at the price of a significant computational effort.
For building the {\small\tt circle}, {\ManiFEM} must first find a starting point for the process
of frontal mesh generation.
In extreme cases, the algorithm may fail to find a starting point on the given manifold.

The user may choose to be more specific in order to save computation time,
by providing a starting point :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                      ]
   \verm{Cell} \azul{A} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (A) = \laranja{1.};  y (A) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, A, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.2} );
\end{Verbatim}

Also, {\maniFEM} must infer the right orientation of the {\small\tt circle}
as explained in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13}.
Choosing the other orientation would result in an endless process of meshing the exterior of
the disk.
The process of choosing the right orientation implies some computational effort.
The user can make things easier for {\maniFEM} either by attaching an orientation
to the manifold {\small\tt circle\_\,manif} (this feature is not implemented yet) or
by providing the initial direction as shown in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12}.


          %----------------%
\section{~~Inner boundaries}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 3}
          %----------------%

Inner boundaries must have the reverse orientation :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,frame=single,
   label=parag-\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 3}.cpp,rulecolor=\color{moldura},
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                                            ]
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{circle} = RR2 .implicit ( x*x + y*y == \laranja{1.} );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{outer} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1} );
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{ellipse} = RR2 .implicit ( x*x + (y-\laranja{0.37})*(y-\laranja{0.37}) + \laranja{0.3}*x*y == \laranja{0.25} );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{inner} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1} );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{bdry} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::join, outer, inner .reverse() );
   RR2 .set_as_working_manifold();
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{disk} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::boundary, bdry, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1} );
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
 \includegraphics[width=95mm]{disk-with-hole}
  \caption{Disk with a hole}
  \label{\numb section 3.\numb fig 2}
\end{figure}

Paragraphs \ref{\numb section 1.\numb parag 2} and \ref{\numb section 1.\numb parag 4} explain
the relation between the orientation of a mesh and the orientation of its boundary.

Paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10} and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13}
explain how {\maniFEM} chooses the orientation of closed curves.


          %--------------------------------%
\section{~~Meshing a three-dimensional loop}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4}
          %--------------------------------%

We may apply the same {\small\tt frontal} algorithm for meshing the circle in
$ \mathbb{R}^3 $ introduced in paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 15} :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,frame=single,
   label=parag-\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4}.cpp,rulecolor=\color{moldura},
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                                            ]
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{RR3} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Euclid, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_dim, \laranja{3} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{xyz} = RR3 .build_coordinate_system ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Lagrange, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_degree, \laranja{1} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{x} = xyz [\laranja{0}], \azul{y} = xyz [\laranja{1}], \azul{z} = xyz [\laranja{2}];
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{circle_manif} = RR3 .implicit ( x*x + y*y == \laranja{1.}, x*y == \laranja{4.}*z );
   
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1},
                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::random          );
\end{Verbatim}

Unlike for the {\small\tt circle} in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2},
there is no way to choose between the two possible orientations of this {\small\tt circle}.
No one is more ``correct'' than the other.
This is why {\maniFEM} requires supplementary arguments
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::random}
for the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor.
In other cases (e.g.\ for closed curves in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $) these supplementary arguments
are not mandatory; however, even then the user may choose to provide them,
thus sparing the computer from the burden of finding the right orientation.
Paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10} and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13}
give more details.

The term ``random'' should not be interpreted in the probabilistic sense.
The orientation of such a mesh is not a random variable, not even a pseudo-random one.
Is it just difficult to predict.

On the other hand, if the orientation matters for you, you can either attach an orientation
to the manifold {\small\tt circle\_\,manif} (this feature is not implemented yet)
or provide a starting point and an initial direction as shown in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12}.


          %----------------------------%
\section{~~Starting and stopping points}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 5}
          %----------------------------%

In paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2} and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4}
we have meshed the entire closed curve {\small\tt circle}.
If we only want a piece of a curve, we must specify two points, one for starting and
the other one for stopping.

Looking at the example in paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 18}, let us define a
spiral with a slightly different look and switch to frontal mesh generation.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,frame=single,
   label=parag-\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 5}.cpp,rulecolor=\color{moldura},
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                                            ]
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{RR2} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Euclid, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_dim, \laranja{2} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{xy} = RR2 .build_coordinate_system ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Lagrange, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_degree, \laranja{1} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{x} = xy [\laranja{0}], \azul{y} = xy [\laranja{1}];
   \verm{Function} \azul{r} = \verm{power} ( x*x + y*y, \laranja{0.25} );
   const double \azul{pi} = \laranja{3.14159};
   
   RR2 .implicit ( x*\verm{sin}(r) == y*\verm{cos}(r) );
   \cinza{// we don't need to give a name to the implicit manifold}
   \cinza{// the Manifold constructor sets the manifold it builds as working manifold}
   \cinza{// after that, many methods use this working manifold by default}
   
   \verm{Cell} \azul{A} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (A) =     pi*pi;   y (A) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Cell} \azul{B} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (B) = \laranja{81.}*pi*pi;   y (B) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{spiral} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, A, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::stop_at, B,
                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{1.}, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::shortest_path     );
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{figure} \centering
  \psfrag{A}{\tt\textcolor{textindraw}{A}}
  \psfrag{B}{\tt\textcolor{textindraw}{B}}
 \includegraphics[width=75mm]{spiral-prog}
  \caption{Spiral, meshed by frontal method}
 \label{\numb section 3.\numb fig 3}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{\numb section 3.\numb fig 3} shows the resulting mesh.

Unlike in paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 18}, we define the spiral through
an implicit equation.
Had we chosen the (natural) definition {\small\tt r = \verm{power} ( x*x + y*y, 0.5 )},
the very same spiral as in paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 18} would have been
obtained.
For aesthetic reasons, we have chosen a different definition of {\small\tt r}, thus obtaining
a different spacing between the arcs of the spiral.

Another noteworthy difference from paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 18} is that
vertices are distributed uniformly along the spiral (with respect to the distance
in the surrounding space $ \mathbb{R}^2 $).
The segments are too small to be seen in the figure.

Note that there are two ways to go along the spiral starting from {\small\tt A}.
One of them will eventually stumble upon the stopping point {\small\tt B} while
the other one will never meet {\small\tt B}.
{\ManiFEM} has no means to guess which way it should start building the mesh;
the {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::shortest\_\,path} instructs it
to perform a preliminary search in both directions.
The one that first meets {\small\tt B} wins and the mesh is subsequently built along
the winning direction.

Thus, if we want to mesh an arc of a circle, we can use a sequence of statements like

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                      ]

   RR2 .implicit ( (x-x0)*(x-x0) + (y-y0)*(y-y0) == radius * radius );
   \verm{Cell} \azul{A} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  \cinza{// set x(A) and y(A)}
   \verm{Cell} \azul{B} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  \cinza{// set x(B) and y(B)}
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{arc_of_circle} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, A, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::stop_at, B,
                        \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \mbox{\fontfamily{helvetica}\selectfont{}some\_\,value}, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::shortest_path );
\end{Verbatim}

However, if we choose {\small\tt A} and {\small\tt B} diametrally opposed, {\maniFEM} will
mesh unpredictably one half of the circle or the other.

Paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12} shows how we can specify the direction we
want to follow starting from a given point, thus avoiding ambiguities and also saving
computational time.

Of course we must be careful to choose starting and stopping points belonging to the manifold
(or to {\small\tt project} them explicitly -- for this we should have given a name to the
implicit manifold) otherwise the meshing algorithm will either fail to start or will spin
for ever on the circle or spiral, hopelessly searching for {\small\tt B}.


          %-------------------------%
\section{~~Meshing a compact surface}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6}
          %-------------------------%

Recall that in this manual we use the term ``manifold'' to mean a manifold without boundary.
So, the term ``compact surface'' should be understood as ``compact surface without boundary''
like the sphere or the torus.

Just like for the {\small\tt circle} in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4}, if we want to mesh a compact surface entirely
the mesh will have no boundary so we only need to provide the desired (average) length
of segments.
Code below builds a mesh on the sphere.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,frame=single,
   label=parag-\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6}.cpp,rulecolor=\color{moldura},
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                                            ]
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{RR3} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Euclid, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_dim, \laranja{3} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{xyz} = RR3 .build_coordinate_system ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Lagrange, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_degree, \laranja{1} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{x} = xyz [\laranja{0}], \azul{y} = xyz [\laranja{1}], \azul{z} = xyz [\laranja{2}];
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{sphere_manif} = RR3.implicit ( x*x + y*y + z*z == \laranja{1.} );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{sphere} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1} );
\end{Verbatim}

Again, a significant computational effort is made for finding a starting point
for the meshing process.
We can alleviate this burden simply by providing a starting point on the sphere :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   \verm{Cell} \azul{A} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (A) = \laranja{1.};  y (A) = \laranja{0.};  z (A) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{sphere} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, A, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1} );
\end{Verbatim}

Also, some computational effort is made for choosing the right orientation of the sphere;
paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10} and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13}
give more details.


          %--------------------------%
\section{~~A more complicated surface}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 7}
          %--------------------------%

Here is an example of a compact surface given by a more complicated implicit equation.
It can be vaguely described as a convolution between two tori.

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering

   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                                            ]
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{RR3} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Euclid, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_dim, \laranja{3} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{xyz} = RR3 .build_coordinate_system ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::Lagrange, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::of_degree, \laranja{1} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{x} = xyz [\laranja{0}], \azul{y} = xyz [\laranja{1}], \azul{z} = xyz [\laranja{2}];

   \verm{Function} \azul{f1} = \verm{max} ( x*x + y*y, \laranja{0.1} );  \cinza{// we cut by 0.1 to avoid singularities}
   \verm{Function} \azul{f2} = \laranja{1.} - \verm{power} ( f1, \laranja{-0.5} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{d1} = z*z + f1 * f2 * f2;  \cinza{// squared distance to a circle in the xy plane}
   \verm{Function} \azul{f3} = \verm{max} (x-\laranja{0.4})*(x-\laranja{0.4}) + z*z, \laranja{0.1} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{f4} = \laranja{1.} - \verm{power} ( f3, \laranja{-0.5} );
   \verm{Function} \azul{d2} = y*y + f3 * f4 *f4;  \cinza{// squared distance to a circle in the xz plane}

   \verm{Manifold} \azul{tori_manif} = RR3 .implicit
      ( \verm{smooth_min} ( d1, d2, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::threshold, \laranja{0.2} ) == \laranja{0.15} );

   \verm{Mesh} \azul{tori} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.09} );
\end{Verbatim}

Function {\small\tt\verm{smooth\_\,min}} gives a smooth approximation of the minimum between
two or more {\small\tt\verm{Function}} objects.
It is equal to the true minimum if the difference between the two values is higher, in
absolute value, than the provided threshold.
When the difference is smaller than the threshold, it gives a $ C^1 $ interpolation between
the two values.

If we want sharp edges, we must build the edges first as explained in paragraphs
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 18} and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 19}.

Comments at the end of paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6} apply here, too :
{\maniFEM} must find a starting point and the right orientation.

and build it with frontal meshing, using fewer lines of code.

\end{Verbatim}

In this example, the issue of the orientation can be really tricky.
An orientation of the {\small\tt circle} is chosen at random.
As a consequence of this random choice, {\maniFEM} will unpredictably mesh the upper or
the lower hemisphere.
Paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10}, \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 14} give more details.


          %-----------------------------%
\section{~~How the orientation is chosen}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10}
          %-----------------------------%

In \maniFEM, cells and meshes are oriented (paragraphs \ref{\numb section 1.\numb parag 2}
and \ref{\numb section 9.\numb parag 5} provide details).
For building a mesh with frontal method, {\maniFEM} needs to know which orientation we want.

Manifolds may be oriented or not.
Euclidian manifolds (that is, the space $ \mathbb{R}^n $) have an intrinsic orientation,
given by the natural order of the $n$ coordinates.
Parametric manifolds inherit the intrinsic orientation from the space of parameters.
Implicit manifolds, however, have no intrinsic orientation.
We can specify an orientation of a manifold by attaching an outer form to it
(this feature is not implemented yet); otherwise, it will be considered not oriented.

In the example in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 1}, the boundary {\small\tt circle}
is oriented according to the four segments composing it, {\small\tt NW}, {\small\tt WS},
{\small\tt SE} and {\small\tt EN}.
\ {\ManiFEM} uses the intrinsic orientation of the surrounding space {\small\tt RR2} in order
to determine the desired orientation of the mesh {\small\tt disk}.
The orientation of the boundary {\small\tt circle} is important;
together with the intrinsic orientation of the surrounding space,
it determines on which side of the circle the mesh will be propagated.
Had we built the segments {\small\tt NW}, {\small\tt WS}, {\small\tt SE} and {\small\tt EN} in the
opposite direction (that is, {\small\tt WN}, {\small\tt SW}, {\small\tt ES} and {\small\tt NE})
the program would try to mesh the exterior of the disk, never stopping.

Compact manifolds of co-dimension one (closed curves in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $,
compact surfaces in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $) are an exception among implicit manifolds.
Recall that in this manual we use the term ``manifold'' to mean a manifold without boundary.
There is a ``privileged'' orientation of a compact manifold of co-dimension one,
which is compatible with the intrinsic orientation of the surrounding space.
We call this orientation {\small\tt inherent}; paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13}
discusses this topic.

Open curves (like the {\small\tt\azul{spiral}} in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 5} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12}), as well as non-compact manifolds
(like the {\small\tt\azul{cylinder}} in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 18} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 19}), have no privileged orientation.
If we don't specify an orientation, these manifolds are considered not oriented.
If we don't specify a starting direction, {\maniFEM} will perform a preliminary search
in both directions and choose the one that first meets the stopping point.

Curves in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $, either closed like the {\small\tt circle} in paragraphs
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4} and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 9} or open,
have no privileged orientation either (because they have co-dimension two).
There is no way to decide which of its two possible orientations
should be chosen; no one is more ``correct'' than the other.
This is why {\maniFEM} will reject a tentative to define {\small\tt\azul{circle}} without
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::random}
as last arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor.
A statement like {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} {\small\tt circle} {\small\tt (}
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired\_\,length,}
some\_\,value {\small\tt)}
will produce a run-time error if the current working manifold has dimension 1 and
the geometric dimension (that is, the number of coordinates) is 3.

The options given to the constructor of {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}}es {\small\tt\azul{circle}} and
{\small\tt\azul{bumpy}} in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 9} are discussed in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 14}.


\section{~~\cinzasec{[empty]}}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 11}


          %------------------------%
\section{~~Specifying the direction}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12}
          %------------------------%

For one-dimensional manifolds, we can specify, along with the starting point,
a starting direction, thus saving some computational time.
The code producing the spiral in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 5}
can be changed as below.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   \verm{Cell} \azul{A} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (A) =    pi*pi;  y (A) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Cell} \azul{B} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (B) = \laranja{81}*pi*pi;  y (B) = \laranja{0.};
   std::vector < double > \azul{direc} = \{ \laranja{0.}, \laranja{1.} \};
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{spiral} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, A, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::towards, direc,
                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::stop_at, B, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{1.}            );
\end{Verbatim}

Note that the vector {\small\tt direc} is associated to the point {\small\tt A}
(is tangent to the manifold at point {\small\tt A}).

Recall that open curves have no ``default'' (or ``inherent'') orientation.
{\ManiFEM} uses the vector {\small\tt direc} as an indication about where to go.

It is the user's responsibility to ensure that, going in the specified direction,
the algorithm will eventually meet the stopping point {\small\tt B}.
Otherwise, we may end up spinning endlessly along the spiral.

We could specify in a similar fashion the orientation of {\small\tt circle} in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2}, thus saving some computational time :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   \verm{Cell} \azul{A} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (A) = \laranja{1.};  y (A) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, A,
                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::towards, \{ \laranja{0.}, \laranja{1.} \}, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.2} );
\end{Verbatim}

If, in the above, we choose the opposite {\small\tt direc}tion,
{\maniFEM} will later try to mesh the exterior of the disk.

The same technique can be used for building the {\small\tt circle} in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 4}, thus avoiding \maniFEM's random choice of the orientation :

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   \verm{Cell} \azul{S} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::vertex );  x (S) = \laranja{0.};  y (S) = \laranja{-1.};  z (S) = \laranja{0.};
   \verm{Manifold} \azul{circle_manif} = RR3 .implicit ( x*x + y*y == \laranja{1.}, x*y == \laranja{4.}*z );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, S,
                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::towards, \{ \laranja{1.}, \laranja{0.}, \laranja{0.} \}, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.2} );
\end{Verbatim}

This also applies to the example in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 9}.
However, there the topologic considerations are more complex, so we delegate this
discussion to paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 14}.


          %---------------------------------------%
\section{~~The intrinsic and inherent orientations}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 13}
          %---------------------------------------%

Euclidian manifolds have an intrinsic orientation given by the natural order of the
coordinates.
{\ManiFEM} will always use this orientation when the working manifold is Euclidian.
We can enforce the requirement of using the intrinsic orientation by providing
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::intrinsic}
as arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor.
However, these arguments are not necessary; {\maniFEM} will consider them by default.
This happens for the {\small\tt\azul{disk}} in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 1} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2}, for the diamond in
paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 17} and for the annulus in paragraphs
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 3}, \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 22}
and \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 24}.

Compact manifolds of co-dimension one (closed curves in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $,
compact surfaces in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $) have a privileged orientation,
compatible with the intrinsic orientation of the surrounding space;
we call this orientation ``inherent''.
Such a manifold cuts the surrounding space in two regions, one of them being bounded;
the ``inherent'' orientation is the one pointing towards the unbounded region;
intuitively speaking, it points ``outwards''.
{\ManiFEM} will choose it in some situations, unless we provide
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::random}
as arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor.
We can enforce the requirement of finding the inherent orientation by providing
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::inherent}
as arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor;
however, {\maniFEM} will consider these arguments by default when we provide no stopping
point (for one-dimensional meshes) or we provide no boundary (for two-dimensional meshes).
In these cases, {\maniFEM} will assume that the manifold is compact and, if it has
co-dimension one, the inherent orientation will be used.
This happens for the {\small\tt\azul{circle}} in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2},
for the {\small\tt\azul{sphere}} in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6} and for the
{\small\tt\azul{tori}} in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 7}.

If we do provide a stopping point, or a boundary, {\maniFEM} has no means to know in
advance whether the manifold
is compact or not, so it will not try to find the inherent orientation.
This happens for the {\small\tt\azul{spiral}} and for the {\small\tt\azul{arc\_\,of\_\,circle}}
in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 5}, for the {\small\tt\azul{bumpy}} hemisphere
in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 9}, for the {\small\tt\azul{piece\_\,of\_\,cyl}} and
{\small\tt\azul{piece\_\,of\_\,sph}} in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 18} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 19} and others.
In these situations, we may require specifically the inherent orientation
by providing the {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,}
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::inherent} arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor.
Do not misuse this option; if you ask {\maniFEM} to find the inherent orientation of an open
curve or of a non-compact surface, it will not complain but will hopelessly try to mesh
the entire manifold, never stopping.
For instance, in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 5} it makes sense to enforce the
inherent orientation for the {\small\tt\azul{arc\_\,of\_\,circle}} but not for the
{\small\tt\azul{spiral}}.
Also, in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 18} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 19} it makes sense to enforce the inherent orientation
for the {\small\tt\azul{piece\_\,of\_\,sph}} but not for the {\small\tt\azul{piece\_\,of\_\,cyl}}.

Determining the intrinsic orientation of a Euclidian manifold is computationally
very cheap.
However, determining the inherent orientation of a manifold of co-dimension one is not
a trivial computational process.
{\ManiFEM} is unable to determine this orientation by looking at the equations defining
the manifold; it needs a mesh on the entire manifold.

So, in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2} we obtain a correctly oriented mesh
on the disk, with no need to provide any specific information about the orientation of
{\small\tt circle\_\,manif}.
Behind the curtains, {\maniFEM} builds a mesh on {\small\tt circle\_\,manif} with
an initially arbitrary orientation, then checks its consistency
within the surrounding manifold and, if necessary, switches the orientation of the produced mesh.
Later, when we ask {\maniFEM} to mesh the {\small\tt\azul{disk}}, the orientation of the boundary
(together with the intrinsic orientation of the surrounding space {\small\tt RR2})
defines whether the interior or the exterior of the disk is to be meshed.

A similar process happens for compact surfaces in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $ like those
considered in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 7},
except that checking the orientation of a compact surface has a computational cost
considerably higher than for a closed curve in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $.

You can save some computing time if you specify the orientation
yourself, either by providing more information to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor as shown
in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 15} or by attaching this information to
the manifold itself (this feature is not implemented yet).
% in order to alleviate the computational burden
 
If the orientation is not important for you, you can add to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor
the arguments {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,}
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::random} and {\maniFEM} will not waste
computing time to find the inherent orientation.


          %-------------------------------%
\section{~~Revisiting the bumpy hemisphere}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 14}
          %-------------------------------%

%The random behaviour in this example is quite dramatic.
Let us have a closer look at the code in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 9}.
The manifold {\small\tt nut} has a unique orientation consistent with the surrounding
space, just like those in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 6} and
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 7}, but the {\small\tt base} within it has not.
This is why, when we build the {\small\tt circle}, we must provide
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::random}
as last arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor,
or specify the orientation by providing a starting point and a starting direction
as described in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12}.

When we build {\small\tt bumpy}, since we are providing a boundary, {\maniFEM} does not treat
the current working manifold {\small\tt nut} as compact, that is, it does not try to determine an
inherent orientation.
It will start the meshing process on an arbitrary side of {\small\tt circle}, thus meshing
unpredictably the upper or the lower {\small\tt bumpy} hemisphere.

If we enforce the orientation by providing
{\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation,} {\small\tt\textcolor{tag}{tag}::inherent} as last
arguments to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor of {\small\tt bumpy},
then {\maniFEM} will mesh (behind the curtains) both halves of the sphere;
let's call them {\small\tt msh1} and {\small\tt msh2}.
Note that the {\small\tt circle} has already been built, so its orientation is given.
Both {\small\tt msh1} and {\small\tt msh2} have {\small\tt circle} as boundary,
which means that they have mutually incompatible orientations.
They cannot be {\small\tt join}ed.
But the reverse of any of them can be {\small\tt join}ed with the other one, the result being a
mesh on the entire bumpy sphere.
Two choices are possible : either {\small\tt msh1.reverse()} is {\small\tt join}ed with
{\small\tt msh2} or {\small\tt msh1} is {\small\tt join}ed with {\small\tt msh2.reverse()},
resulting in two meshes on the same compact surface with opposite orientations.
One of these orientations is compatible with the intrinsic orientation of the surrounding space
$ \mathbb{R}^3 $ and is called inherent orientation.
If the first one is correctly oriented, {\small\tt msh2} will be returned;
if the second one is correctly oriented, {\small\tt msh1} will be returned.
\vfil\eject

Thus, in the code below we will obtain the upper hemisphere.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,

                 \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, \laranja{0.1}                                     );

\end{Verbatim}

Code below will produce the lower hemisphere.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                      ]

\end{Verbatim}

Code below will unpredictably mesh the upper or the lower hemisphere;
in either case, the produced mesh will be oriented upwards because the orientation
of {\small\tt circle} points upwards.
Here, the word ``upwards'' is used in the sense of the right hand rule
(see paragraph \ref{\numb section 1.\numb parag 2}).

Code below will unpredictably mesh the upper or the lower hemisphere;

Code below will still mesh unpredictably either the upper or the lower
hemisphere, but only due to the random choice in the orientation of {\small\tt circle}.

In paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 12} we have seen how we can specify the direction

A similar approach can be taken for two-dimensional meshes.

\section{~~Geometric limitations}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 16}
          %---------------------%

Frontal meshing has its limits.
{\ManiFEM} cannot mesh a manifold whose curvature is too high when compared to the
length of the segments.
The example in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 7} is ``on the edge'', that is,
if we increase the segment size the meshing process will probably get stuck somewhere.

Also, we should avoid domains whose boundary has components too close to each other,
when compared to the segment size.
In this respect, the example in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 3} is also
``on the edge''.
In contrast, {\maniFEM} is ``at ease'' when meshing the same domain with other options,
like in paragraphs \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 22}, \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 23}
or \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 24}.

Sharp edges and singularities must be dealt with as described in subsequent paragraphs.

The example in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 1} is also ``on the edge''
for a different reason.
While {\maniFEM} tries to build a mesh with segments of constant given length,
the length of the segments on the boundary of the disk varies (paragraphs
\ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 4} and \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 5} explain why).
This contradiction puts the algorithm in a difficult position.
If the variation were larger (or sharper) the algorithm might stop with some error message.
In contrast, {\maniFEM} is ``at ease'' when meshing the disk in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 2} because there the segments on the boundary have
(approximately) constant length.

This is a good place to mention that \maniFEM's frontal meshing algorithm is still not
as robust as we would like it to be.
In rare occasions, it reports as ``unmanageable'' certain geometric configurations which
should be manageable.
A fresh implementation is on its way.

\section{~~Sharp angles}\label{\numb section 3.\numb parag 17}
          %------------%

{\ManiFEM} can deal with non-smooth domains.
The user must define separately smooth pieces of the boundary and then join them.

Here is how to mesh the diamond-shaped domain in paragraph \ref{\numb section 2.\numb parag 11}.

We can mesh surfaces with sharp edges, by building individually smooth pieces of surface

The edges must be built first;
thus, some previous knowledge about the geometry of the surface is needed.

Note how the orientation is important (see paragraphs \ref{\numb section 1.\numb parag 2}
and \ref{\numb section 1.\numb parag 4}).
For meshing the piece of cylinder, we provide its future boundary which is the union of
{\small\tt circle\_\,1} with {\small\tt circle\_\,2.reverse()}.
For meshing the sphere, we provide {\small\tt circle\_\,2}.
In figure \ref{\numb section 3.\numb fig 6}, where a crack has been opened artificially,
we see that the common boundary has a certain orientation when seen from the cylinder and
has the opposite orientation when seen from the sphere.
If we do not respect these orientations, {\maniFEM} will be unable to {\small\tt join} the two
meshes.

\begin{figure}[ht] \centering
 \includegraphics[width=100mm]{crack}
  \caption{Zoom around the joint}
  \label{\numb section 3.\numb fig 6}
\end{figure}

Note that {\small\tt intersection} is a disconnected manifold, made of two closed loops,
one of them being {\small\tt circle\_\,2} (the other one shows up in
paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 19} under the name {\small\tt circle\_\,3}).
We must provide detailed information to the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor in order to
obtain the correct loop with the correct orientation.
A statement like

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle_2} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, seg_size );
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent would produce a run-time error asking the user to specify the orientation
(see comments in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 10} about curves in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $).
If we didn't care about the orientation (but we do care in this example), we could use
a constructor like

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{circle_2} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, seg_size,
                   \textcolor{tag}{tag}::orientation, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::random               );
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent and {\maniFEM} would mesh one connected component of the manifold {\small\tt intersection}
(we would have no control on which component {\maniFEM} happens to find).

If we want to close the extremity of the cylinder, it suffices to add a few lines of code$\,$:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},formatcom=\small\tt,
   baselinestretch=0.94,framesep=2mm                     ]
   RR3 .implicit ( x == \laranja{1.5} );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{disk} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::frontal, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::boundary, circle_1 .reverse(),
               \textcolor{tag}{tag}::start_at, start_1, \textcolor{tag}{tag}::towards, \{ \laranja{0.}, \laranja{0.}, \laranja{-1.} \},
               \textcolor{tag}{tag}::desired_length, seg_size                         );
   \verm{Mesh} \azul{sphere_and_cylinder} ( \textcolor{tag}{tag}::join, piece_of_sph, piece_of_cyl, disk );
\end{Verbatim}

We have chosen the diameter of the cylinder slightly smaller than $1$.
Had we chosen a diameter equal to $1$, the cylinder would be tangent to the sphere at point
$ (0,0,1) $.
At that point, the two equations defining the {\small\tt intersection} manifold would be
degenerate (the Jacobian matrix would not have full rank).
This is a situation which {\maniFEM} cannot handle yet; it is discussed in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 21}.

In {\maniFEM}, an implicit manifold is simply a level set of one or two symbolic expressions
involving the coordinates of the surrounding, Euclidean manifold.
However, in the neighbourhood of a singularity, the equation(s) are degenerate and certain
parts of {\maniFEM} do not work as expected.
In particular, the projection algorithm onto the manifold may fail to converge.
By specifying (in the {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} constructor) {\small\tt V} as singular point,
we tell {\maniFEM} that it must take special care in that neighbourhood.

Unlike in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 19}, here we cannot {\small\tt join} the
two meshes {\small\tt circle\_\,1} and {\small\tt circle\_\,2}.
{\ManiFEM} is unable to join two closed polygonal lines having a vertex in common;
in other words, it does not handle self-intersecting {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}}es.
This is why we provide the two pieces of boundary separately.

Compare with the mesh in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 3}.

It is the user's responsibility to provide a length {\small\tt d} which takes positive values
at all points of the future mesh.
Also, {\small\tt d} should be a reasonably smooth function; sharp variations should be avoided.

\medskip

We can attach a non-uniform metric to our manifold; as a consequence, for a constant
{\small\tt desired\_\,length}, the apparent segment length will vary from zone to zone.
For instance, in the code below we set a metric which increases the measured length
of the segments close to the narrow part of the domain.
As a consequence, the meshing algorithm, while trying to build a mesh of constant
{\small\tt desired\_\,length}, will choose shorter segments in the proximity of the narrow zone
(because the length measured by the Riemann metric will be larger than the length
we see in the drawing), thus producing the same result as in paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 22}.

These two approaches (the one described in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 22} and
the one described here) can be used interchangeably.
It is possible to use both in the same code, but the code will become rather obscure.

{\normalfont\bfseries The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.

\medskip

The technique described in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 23} can be generalized to
an anisotropic Riemann metric.
We define the metric by means of a square matrix $M$.
$M$ must be symmetric positive definite.
The arguments of {\small\tt set\_\,metric} are $ m_{11} $, $ m_{12} $ and $ m_{22} $
for two dimensions,
$ m_{11} $, $ m_{12} $, $ m_{13} $, $ m_{22} $, $ m_{23} $ and $ m_{33} $ for three dimensions.

Compare with the mesh in paragraph \ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 3}.

This result cannot be achieved using the approach of paragraph
\ref{\numb section 3.\numb parag 22} (by setting a non-constant desired length).
