\label{\numb section 13.\numb parag 1}

A {\small\tt\verm{Mesh}} is a collection of {\small\tt\verm{Cell}}s of the
same dimension.

A {\small\tt\verm{Manifold}} is a {\tt C++} object modelling an abstract concept.
There are Euclidian {\small\tt\verm{Manifold}}s, there are implicitly defined
sub-{\small\tt\verm{Manifold}}s, there are parametric {\small\tt\verm{Manifold}}s
and also quotient {\small\tt\verm{Manifold}}s.
